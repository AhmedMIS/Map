# Angular Assignment
In this I have use AGM and a form where user can submit the lat and lan and accoding to lat and lan a marker will be generated. You can drag the marker to update its postion. It will also draw a polyline on entering a new marker. You can also delete the marker that is only for the front end and also make a function which is in Comments. Uncomment that function and it will also delete the marker from backend. Thanks
